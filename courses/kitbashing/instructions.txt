objective: Kitbash a model inside blender and display it as an AR app on our android or IOS device.


- open the kitbash.blend . file
- make a selection of 3 or 4 models and copy them to a new blender scene.
- kitbash a model together using the basic translation rotation and scaling techniques.
- when you have composed/imported a model, we can apply a shader, or a material.


- open the shader editor in a new window and make a shader. 
lets bake this texture so we have better quality control in gameengine. 
- in order to bake our texture, we first need to unwrap it. This is done by calculating the optimal uv coordinates or each vertex, or "uv unwrapping".

- Bake the passes to 1 single texture. to do this, we need to add an image texture to our shader.
- apply a decimate modifier to reduce the polygons. Apply this modifier.
- export the model and texture. make sure scaling is adjusted and the model is located in the center.
